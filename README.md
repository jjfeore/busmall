# Week 3 - Bus Mall
The following is a basic catalog of my work on the Bus Mall lab over the course of week 3 of Code Fellows 201.

##Day 1
*20 MAR 2017*
Started work and began with writing up some user stories, and planning out the technical design of the page. At present, the page is designed to show 3 different images from a list of 18 provided images, and allow the focus group user to select one. The information is tallied, before another 3 unique images are presented. After 25 rounds, no new images are displayed, and the statistics are provided.
